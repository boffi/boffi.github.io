          <h2>Modal Contributions and Static Correction</h2>
          <p class="first">
            The first part of this class was actually devoted to
            closing the previous week lesson.
          </p><p>
            To this effect, we have seen one example on Rayleigh-Ritz
            procedure, we discussed the Subspace Iteration Method and
            finally a last exercise on subspace iteration.
          </p><p class="first">
            The second part was devoted to the analysis of the
            relative imortance of the different modal contributions to
            the response.
          </p><p>
            First, we introduced the modal partecipation factor and
            from this definition we derived the idea of modal load
            contributions. Modal partecipation factors depend on the
            "tuning" between the loading vector and the respective
            eigenvectors.
          </p><p>
            Second, we recognized that it is possible, mode for mode,
            to separate the dynamic response, expressed in terms of a
            pseudo-displacement, from a pseudo-static response due to
            the modal load contribution.
          </p><p>
            Next, we introduced the modal contribution factor, the
            dynamic response amplification factor and the peak factors.
          </p><p>
            Finally, we recognized that, for a given response
            quantity, we have a static response that, mode by mode, is
            modulated by a a dynamic amplification and a constant
            modal contribution factor.
          </p><p>
            The dynamic amplification is null, and the response is
            essentially static, for modal frequencies much larger than
            the the excitation frequency.
          </p><p>
            From this consideration, the static correction procedure
            insert into the response the higher modes contributions in
            term of an enveloping of a static response that, surprise,
            can be computed also in terms of the lower modes
            characteristics!
