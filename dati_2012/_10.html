          <p class="first">
            Today a sort of miscellanea to close the topic of
            <em>MDOF</em> systems.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><h4>Derived Ritz Vectors</h4> The Derived Ritz
              Vectors follows from a combination of matrix iteration and
              Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation.<br></br>
              Remarkable properties of <em>DRVs</em> are:
              <ul>
                <li>orthogonalisation is needed only with respect to
                  the two previous <em>DRVs</em></li>
                <li>one of the two sweeping coefficients needed was
                already computed as a normalization factor in the
                preceding step</li>
                <li>the reduced, Ritz coordinates eigenproblem can be
                easily formulated in canonical form with respect to a
                tridiagonal matrix</li>
                <li>the equation of motion for Ritz coordinates can be
                written with a tridiagonal mass matrix, a unit
                stiffness matrix and a load vector that has only one
                coefficient different from zero</li>
                <li>even for complex load shape, the expansion of load
                shape in terms of <em>DRVs</em> requires only a few
                lower terms, removing the requirement for static
                correction that, for these loadings, is needed in
                modal superposition procedure</li>
              </ul>
            </li>          
            <li><h4>Algorithms for the Numerical Integration of
                <em>MDOF</em> systems</h4>
              Main problem in numerical integration of the equation of
              motion for a <em>MDOF</em> system is the numerical
              stability of the algorithm used. In short, only
              unconditionally stable algorithms can be used.<br></>
              It turns out that -formally- the algorithms are
              identical to the algorithms discussed in the context of
              <em>SDOF</em> systems, with identical numerical
              coefficients and dimensional scalar factors substituted
              by corresponding matrices.
              <ul>
                <li>the constant acceleration algorithm is
                unconditionally stable, we discussed a pseudocode
                listing that implements the c-a algorithm </li>
                <li>a variation on the linear acceleration algorithm,
                introduced by Wilson and named Wilson's theta method,
                is unconditionally stable</li>
              </ul>
              As direct numerical integration is usually needed for
              non-linear system, finally we reviewed the modified
              Newton-Raphson procedure.
            </li>
            <li><h4>Multiple Support Excitation</h4>
              Multiple support excitation occurs in different cases,
              e.g., multi-span bridges, vehicles, equipment contained
              in vibration affected environments, etc.

              We recognized that in the vast majority of cases the
              equation of motion can be written in terms of the
              supports' accelerations only.
