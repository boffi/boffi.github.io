          <h2>Step by Step Methods</h2>
          <p class="first">
            Today's class was devoted to the numerical methods for the
            integration of the equation of motion in the time domain,
            that we collectively name <i>Step by Step Methods</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We introduced the concept of the <em>state</em> of a
            linear or non linear system, and the idea of computing the
            state of the system at the end of a short time step as a
            mean to compute, step by step, the response of a SDOF
            system in an approximate manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific qualities and defects of SbS methods were
            discussed at some length, especially the cause of errors
            and the problem of <i>numerical instability</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, we discussed the <i>Central Differences
            Method</i>, an <i>unstable</i> method that appeals the
            numerical analyst with its semplicity. The method gives
            also a taste of the structure of step by step solutions,
            where the end state is expressed in terms of the initial
            state and the values of the loadings at the extremes of
            the step.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central differences is an explicit method, next we
            introduced <em>implicit</em> methods, that can be
            collected under the name of <em>Newmark's Beta
            Methods</em>, and we studied in particular the
            <em>Constant</em> and the <em>Linear Acceleration
            Methods</em>, the Constant Acceleration being remarkable
            as it is a <em>stable</em> method of integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ended introducing the modified Newton-Raphson method
            for the solution of non linear problems, with the
            discussion of an elasto-plastic system.
          </p>
          <h2>Rigid Body Assemblages</h2> 
	  <p>
	    Sometimes an assemblage of rigid bodies, springs and
	    dampers happens to be a single degree of freedom
	    system.<br></br>
	    In this case, the equation of motion can be written
	    determining all the forces acting on the system (using the
	    D'Alembert principle for the determination of inertial
	    forces) in terms of the sole free variable and using the
	    Principle of Virtual Displacements for rigid bodies (for a
	    rigid, virtual displacement the virtual work of the
	    external forces must be equal to zero).</p>
	  <p>
	    We have seen a number of examples.</p>

	      Please note that the above are links to a site that
	      renders <em>statically</em> my notebooks in your
	      browser. Would you like to interact with the notebooks,
	      <ol>
		<li> 
		  open a notebook using one of the links above</li>
		<li>
		  download the notebook using the top-right icon</li>
		<li>
		  start the ipython notebook server in the same
		  directory where you have saved the notebook (you can
		  save many notebooks in the same directory).
	      </ol> 

	      What about the <em>ipython notebook server</em> bit in
	      the above sentence? If you're a Mac or Windows user, my
	      suggestion is <a
	      href="http>//continuum.io/downloads">the Anaconda python
	      distribution</a>, where you can find an installer that
	      fills your hard disk, ahem, that puts all the relevant
	      items in place. When you're done, open a Terminal.app
	      a.k.a. command prompt, cd to the directory with the
	      notebooks and type <code>ipython
	      notebook</code>... Caveat: last time I tried on windows,
	      IE didn't work and I had to use chrome as my
	      browser. Your experience could be different.
