          <ol>
            <li><strong>You must do the new homework</strong> and submit it in due time if
              you have not submitted the first homework or you scored

            <li><em>you can do the new homework</em> if you want to better your score;
              please beware that you cannot choose the best score between
              this homework and the first one, i.e., submitting a new homework
              you make me forget the first one.

          <p>You shall submit your solutions (printed or nicely

            in June, July, September or even February 2012.</p>

          <p>I posted <a href="dati_2011/ha01/Degrees.xls">
              your degrees</a>, note that for every wrong solution there
              is a comment: hover the nmouse over a cell to see the comment.</p> 

          <h2>1<sup>st</sup> assignment's solutions</h2>

          <h2>Suspension on 2011-05-17 and hand in</h2>

          <p>The lessons and all the activities will be suspended on
            2011-05-17 and 18 to give place to the University
            Conference on Teaching.</p>

          <p>Your assignment being due for 2011-05-17 there is a
            little problem as I will not be in Lecco to receive your
            papers... in any case you can submit your papers by email,
            or if you prefer to hand in a printed/handwritten copy you
            can give it to Ms Elena Corbetta, in the office next to
            the reception.

          <h2>Clarification on the assignment due on 2011-05-17</h2>
          <p>If you plan to do your exam in September or later,
            you're not strictly requested to submit the assigment
            due 2011-04-17.  As an alternative, you will receive,
            near the
            end of August, a different assignment on the same
            arguments of this one, due a week before the September
            exam.</p>
          
          <p>On the other hand, if you want to do the exam in July you
            must submit the current assigment in due terms</p>
          
          <p>The second assignment, that I'll publish before the end
            of the course, is due on the day of your exam, in July or
            in September or later.</p>
          
          <h2>First homework assignment</h2>
          
          <p>The first homework assignment is due for 2010-05-17.
            The <a href="dati_2011/ha01.pdf">text</a> of the problems
            is online.</p>
          
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> The course deals with the dynamical response of mechanical
            systems, linear and non-linear, under the assumption of small
            displacements.</p>
          
          <p>Focus is given to analytical and numerical methods for the
            integration of the equations of motion, both in time and in
            frequency domain, to the numerical methods for the
            eigen-analysis of multiple degrees of freedom systems and to
            earthquake engineering applications.</p>
          
          <p>Classes include tutorials and computational exercises.</p>
          
          <p> During the semester, you'll be given two home assignments,
            the former approximately in mid may, the latter at the end
            of the lessons. Starting from this year, <a
              href="sd_2011.html">Dynamics of Structures</a> is a 5
            credits module in the 15 credits course <a
              href="sd_2011.html">Structural Analysis</a>, so that, at the
            moment, I can only say that a part of your degree will be
            based on the home assignments. I'll be more specific as
            soon as possible</p>
          
          <p> The slides i use in classes will be made available on this
            page in a short time after the classes, but older versions
            of the slides are already available, as i taught the same
            course, more or less the same course, in the previous
            academic years.  Would you like to peek at the material i
            posted during the previous years, here it is...

          <ul>
            <li>Ray W,Clough, Joseph Penzien,
              <a href="http://orders.csiberkeley.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=DOC%2DDYNOFSTR">
                Dynamics of Structures</a>.<br>
                Please note that the standard 2nd edition is out of
                press, but the link points to a software house that has bought
                the rights and issued a revised edition of the classic book by
                Clough and Penzien.</li>
            <li> Anil K.Chopra,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Prentice-Hall-International-Engineering-Mechanics/dp/013156174X/ref=sr_1_2/103-6948756-4924603?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193316341&sr=1-2">
                Dynamics of Structures </a> (Theory and Applications
              to Earthquake Engineering), 3rd ed.<br>
                A number of copies of this book are available from
                the campus library in Lecco.<br>
                  Should you find a hugely discounted used copy
                  of the 2nd edition of prof. Chopra's book, don't worry
                  and buy it, the 2nd ed. is good enough for our
                  purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>90% of the material you'll see in the first part of the course
            is inspired from Clough and Penzien's book, 90% of the material of
            the second part of the course from Chopra's.</p>
          <p>While it is very easy to follow the first part of the course
            using Chopra as your reference (the difference being in some
            notational convention and a more liberal use of examples in
            Chopra), following the second part of the course using the book
            from Clough and Penzien as a reference may be difficult.</p>
          <p>In short, should you prefer to buy a single book, buy Chopra's.</p>
          
          <h2>Home assignments</h2>
          
          <p>The home assignments that you're supposed to do require no more
            than pencil and paper (a hand-held calculatur being however
            useful for eventuality of a sine or a cosine...).
          </p>

          <p> Of course, you may feel more at ease and be more productive
            using a decent spreadsheet program,<a href =
            "//office.microsoft.com/excel"> Excel </a> or <a
              href = "//www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">OpenOffice
              Calc</a> <small>(aka <a href =
              "//www.libreoffice.org/features/calc/"> LibreOffice
              Calc</a>)</small> being the names that spring to mind...</p>
          
          <p>Of course, anything more sophisticated than Excel (think of <a
              href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a
              href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, or of
            Matlab's free clone <a href="http://www.octave.org"> Octave</a>)
            can be helpful.</p>
          
          <p>When i work preparing and solving the assignments, my setup
            comprises:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              manipulation of matrices, symbolic derivation and
              integration and much, much more. <br><small>Not
              Mathematica, very different from Mathematica, however
              Calc is useful and free.</small></br></li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Scipy</a>, a library of
              scientific tools for the programming language Python. <br>
                <small>I prefer using a set of libraries from inside a
                  full blown programming language (Python) than using an
                  ad hoc programming language (Matlab, Octave).<br> Of
                    course, Matlab has different assets... (toolkits,
                    i.e.)</small>
            </li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> itself, an
