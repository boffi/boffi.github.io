          <h2>Step by Step Methods</h2>
          <p class="first">
            Today's class was devoted to the numerical methods for the
            integration of the equation of motion in the time domain,
            that we collectively name <i>Step by Step Methods</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We introduced the concept of the <em>state</em> of a
            linear or non linear system, and the idea of computing the
            state of the system at the end of a short time step as a
            mean to compute, step by step, the response of a SDOF
            system in an approximate manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific qualities and defects of SbS methods were
            discussed at some length, especially the cause of errors
            and the problem of <i>numerical instability</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, we discussed the <i>Central Differences
            Method</i>, an <i>unstable</i> method that appeals the
            numerical analyst with its semplicity. The method gives
            also a taste of the structure of step by step solutions,
            where the end state is expressed in terms of the initial
            state and the values of the loadings at the extremes of
            the step.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central differences is an explicit method, next we
            introduced <em>implicit</em> methods, that can be
            collected under the name of <em>Newmark's Beta
            Methods</em>, and we studied in particular the
            <em>Constant</em> and the <em>Linear Acceleration
            Methods</em>, the Constant Acceleration being remarkable
            as it is a <em>stable</em> method of integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ended introducing the modified Newton-Raphson method
            for the solution of non linear problems, with the
            discussion of an elasto-plastic system.<br>
            </br>The homework assigned was about an elastoplastic
            system subjected to an impulsive loading.
