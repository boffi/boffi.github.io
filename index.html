          <h2>Organization</h2>

          <p>This year we'll have 11 classes and 3 tutorial sessions.</p>

          <p>The classes will be every Tuesday and Thursday, except for
	    Thursday March 23rd, when you'll enjoy a tutorial
	    session. The other two tutorials are scheduled for Friday
	    April 7th and Friday April 28th.</p>
	  
	  <p> Following each of the first two tutorials you will
	    receive a set of homework problems: if you return your
	    homework (detailed instructions will follow) it will be
	    corrected  so that you can check your preparation.
	    The homeworks are strictly optional.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> The slides I use will be posted here after each class,
	    as well as solved problems and other classroom materials
	    [1], but please understand that the slides, etc, are not a
	    substitute for a real textbook (see below).

	    <br>If you want to have a look at the slides <em>before</em>
	    a class, <a href="sd_2016.html">last year's slides are a
		click away</a>.</br>
          </p>

	  <p><small>[1] Other classroom materials means, mostly, small
              computer programs, written in
              the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming
		language</a> rather than in other languages with wich
              you might be most familiar. OTOH, in the tutorials we
	      will use the programming languages you're possibly most
	      familiar with.
	  </small></p>
	  
	  <h2>Exam</h2>

	  <p>The exam consists in a classroom written test and an oral
	    test.</p>

	  <p> The written test, mostly an admission test for the oral,
	    consists in a set of problems that require no software for
	    their solution. The problems will be similar to the
	    homeworks' ones.
	  </p>

	  <p> The oral test consists in a Q&A session, you are
	    expected to be able to discuss all the different topics of
	    the course.</p>

	  <h2>Recommended text books</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Anil K.Chopra,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Prentice-Hall-International-Engineering-Mechanics/dp/0132858037/">
                Dynamics of Structures </a> (Theory and Applications
              to Earthquake Engineering), 4th ed.
            </li>
            <li>Ray W. Clough, Joseph Penzien,
              <a href="http://orders.csiberkeley.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=DOC%2DDYNOFSTR">
                Dynamics of Structures</a>.<br> This classic text is
                solely sold by the software house linked above.</br>
	      You can find an used copy with a bit of luck.
	    </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The course is mostly inspired by Clough and Penzien's
	    book, but for many topics it follows Chopra's approach and
	    examples. Should you prefer to buy a single book, my
	    advice is "Buy Chopra's".</p>

          <small><p> Note that</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>you can find copies of former editions of Chopra's
		book, that are OK for my course, at much lower prices, </li>
	      <li><strong>a fair number of copies of Chopra's book
		  (3rd ed.) are available from the Campus Library in
		  Lecco.</strong></li>
	    </ul>
	  </small>
	  <h2>Homeworks & Software</h2>

	  <p> The homework problems sometimes require you to plot a
	    time series or perform some matrix algebra, but every
	    half-decent spreadsheet
	    (say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Excel</a>
	    or <a href=" can do those
			things.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a>)
	    can do these things.</p>
	  
	  <p>Of course you can do better and write
	    a computer program using,
	    e.g., <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>,
	    <a href=
               "http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>
            or Matlab's free clone <a href="http://www.octave.org">
              Octave</a> to perform all the computations and generate the plots.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    All the proprietery software I mentioned, as well as many
	    other applications and development tools, can be freely
	    downloaded
	    from <a href="http://www.software.polimi.it/en/software-download/students/">a
	    specificPolitecnico site</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p><small>	      
	      In the classes I sometimes will use, to demonstrate	      
	      <i>live</i> coding,
	      the <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">Jupyter
		notebook</a>. To have an idea of what I'm talking of,
              <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57755729/boffi/nb/2016_Support_Motion.ipynb">
		here it is the solution</a>
	      of a recently assigned problem presented as a notebook.
