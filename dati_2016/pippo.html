          <h2>Step by Step Methods</h2>
          <p class="first">
            The first part of today's lesson was devoted to the
            numerical methods for the integration of the equation of
            motion in the time domain, that we collectively
            name <i>Step by Step Methods</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            We introduced the concept of the <em>state</em> of a
            linear or non linear system, and the idea of computing the
            state of the system at the end of a short time step as a
            mean to compute, step by step, the response of a SDOF
            system in an approximate manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific qualities and defects of SbS methods were
            discussed at some length, especially the cause of errors
            and the problem of <i>numerical instability</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, we discussed the <i>Central Differences
            Method</i>, an <i>unstable</i> method that appeals the
            numerical analyst with its semplicity. The method gives
            also a taste of the structure of step by step solutions,
            where the end state is expressed in terms of the initial
            state and the values of the loadings at the extremes of
            the step.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central differences is an explicit method, next we
            introduced <em>implicit</em> methods, that can be
            collected under the name of <em>Newmark's Beta
            Methods</em>, and we studied in particular the
            <em>Constant</em> and the <em>Linear Acceleration
            Methods</em>, the Constant Acceleration being remarkable
            as it is a <em>stable</em> method of integration.
          </p>

          <h2>Generalized SDOF Systems</h2>
          <p class="first">
	    In the second part, we started yhe study of generalized SDOF systems.
            Sometimes an articulated rigid body happens to be a single degree of freedom system,
            sometimes we want to approximate the dynamical behaviour of a deformable,
            infinite degrees of freedom system with a simple, single degree of freedom
            <emph>model</emph>.
          </p>
	  <p> First, we study the behaviour of assemblages of rigid bodies, connected by
            bilateral, frictionless constraints and by springs and dampers, when
            the resulting system has one degree of freedom. Under the hypotesis of small
            displacements we find the instantaneous motion of every piece of the system,
            and write the equation of equilibrium (including inertial forces) using the principle
            of virtual displacements. The concept of generalized characteristic is introduced.
          </p>
	  <p> A similar procedure can be applied also to deformable bodies, <emph>assuming</emph>
            an instantaneous motion that satisfies external constraints and taking into account
            the internal virtual work in writing the equation of motion. Solving the equation
            of motion gives the amplitude of the <emph>assumed shape</emph> motion of the
            deformable body.
