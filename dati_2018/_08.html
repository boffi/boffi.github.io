          <h2>Modal Contributions and Static Correction</h2>
          <h3>Modal contributions</h3>
          <p class="first">
            We analyze the common case in which the dynamic load can
            be expressed by a constant load vector \(\boldsymbol r\)
            modulated by an adimensional function of time,
            \(f(t)\) (e.g., the seismic excitation can be
            described in such terms).
            <ul>
              <li> We start our argument introducing the modal
                partecipation factor: the MPF measures the "tuning"
                between the loading vector and the modal shape.
              </li>

              <li> Reasoning on the definition of the MPF, we find that
                it is possible to represent the load as a sum of modal
                load contributions, \(\boldsymbol r = \sum \boldsymbol r_i\).
              </li>
              <li> Next, we recognize that it is possible, mode for
                mode, to represent the modal response in terms of a
                constant, pseudo-static response, due to the modal
                load contribution, modulated by a (nearly)
                adimensional response function.
              </li> 

              <li> Introducing <em>a)</em> the modal contribution
		factor, the ratio between the modal response
		contribution and the static response, <em>b)</em> the
		dynamic response amplification factor and <em>c)</em>
		the peak factors, we finally see that it is possible
		to single out the effects of the static response and
		the dynamic amplification.
	      </li>
            </ul></p>

	  <h3>Static correction</h3>

	  <p class="first">
	    We have recognized that, for a given response quantity, we
	    have a static response that, mode by mode, is modulated by
	    a a dynamic amplification and a constant modal
	    contribution factor.
          </p><p>
            For modal frequencies much larger than the excitation
            frequency, the dynamic amplification tends to unity and
            the response is essentially static.
          </p><p>
            From this consideration, the static correction procedure
            insert into the response the higher modes contributions in
            term of an enveloping of a static response that, surprise,
            can be computed also in terms of the lower modes
            characteristics!
          </p>
	  <h2>Numerical Integration</h2>
	  <p class="first"> It's the same as Numerical Integration for
	    SDOF system as long as all physical constants are replaced
	    by the corresponding matrices and all the variables and
	    and unknowns are replaced by vectors.
	  </p>
	  <p>It's different because we cannot use, at least in real
	    problems, numerical procedures that are conditionally
	    stable... we can use only unconditionally stable algorithms
	  </p>
	  <p>We reviewed the Constant Acceleration algorithm.</p>

	  <p>We introduced the Wilson's \(\theta\) method, that has the
	  same, or better, accuracy of the Linear Acceleration
	    algorithm but can be made unconditionally stable.</p>

	  <h2>Multiple Support Excitation</h2>

	  <p class="first"> To treat multiple support excitation we
	    have to introduce additional degrees of freedom,
	    corresponding the the imposed component of ground motion
	    and partition the augmented coordinates vector in two,
	    the displacements of the superstructure and the (imposed)
	    displacements of the ground. The Superstructure
	    displacement are then represented as the superposition of
	    static displacements and dynamic ones.</p>
	  <p> In this frame, it is possible to write the equation of
	    motion in a form similar to what we use for earthquake
	    excitation, introducing an influence matrix \(\boldsymbol
	    E\) that describes the static superstructural displacements
	    due to an arbitrary vector of ground displacement,
	    \[\boldsymbol p_\text{eff} = -\boldsymbol M\,\boldsymbol E\,
	    \ddot{\boldsymbol x}_\text{g}.\]</p>
