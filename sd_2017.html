          <h2>Organization</h2>

          <p>This year we'll have 11 classes and 3 tutorial sessions.</p>

          <p>The classes will be every Tuesday and Thursday, except for
	    Thursday March 23rd, when you'll enjoy a tutorial
	    session. The other two tutorials are scheduled for Friday
	    April 7th and Friday April 28th.</p>
	  
	  <p>Following each of the first two tutorials you will
	    receive a set of homework problems, intended to let you
	    check your preparation. If you return the homework a week
	    later (detailed instructions will follow) it will be
	    corrected and returned to you.<br>
	      I think that you should do and submit the homework, but
	      it's strictly optional.</br>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> The slides I use will be posted here after each class,
	    as well as solved problems and other classroom materials
	    [1], but please understand that the materials (slides etc)
	    that I post here are not a substitute for a real textbook
	    (see below)

	    <br>If you want to have a look at the slides <em>before</em>
	    a class, <a href="sd_2016.html">last year's slides are a
		click away</a>.</br>
          </p>

	  <p><small>[1]  Other classroom materials means mostly small
              computer programs, written in
              the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming
              language</a> rather than in other languages with wich
              you might be most familiar. OTOH, in the tutorials we
	      will use the programming languages you're possibly most
	      familiar with.
	  </small></p>
	  <h2>Exam</h2>

	  <p>The exam is based on a classroom written test and an oral
	    test.</p>

	  <p>The written test is mostly an admission test for the oral
	    exam, in other words your final mark will be based mainly
	    on the oral exam.</p>

	  <h2>Recommended text books</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Anil K.Chopra,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Prentice-Hall-International-Engineering-Mechanics/dp/0132858037/">
                Dynamics of Structures </a> (Theory and Applications
              to Earthquake Engineering), 4th ed.
            </li>
            <li>Ray W. Clough, Joseph Penzien,
              <a href="http://orders.csiberkeley.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=DOC%2DDYNOFSTR">
                Dynamics of Structures</a>.<br> This classic text is
                solely sold by the software house linked above.</br>
	      You can find an used copy with a bit of luck.
	    </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The course is mostly inspired by Clough and Penzien's
	    book, but for many topics it follows Chopra's approach and
	    examples. Should you prefer to buy a single book, my
	    advice is "Buy Chopra's".</p>

          <p><small> Note that copies of the 2nd and 3rd editions of
	      Chopra's book (now at the 4th edition) are widely
	      available at lower prices and these older editions are
	      perfectly appropriate for my course. Note also
	      that <strong>a fair number of copies of Chopra's book
	      (3rd ed.) are
		available from the Campus Library in Lecco</strong>.
	  </small></p>

	  <h2>Homeworks</h2>

	  <p> The homework problems sometimes require a little more
	    than paper, pencil and a hand-held calculator, e.g. you
	    have to plot a time series or perform some matrix algebra,
	    but every half-decent spreadsheet
	    (say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Excel</a>
	    or <a href=" can do those
	    things.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a>)
	    can do these things.

	  </br>If you are able to program a computer, there are
	  programming languages tailored for the particular needs of
	  an engineer,
	  e.g. <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>,
	    <a href=
              "http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>
            or Matlab's free clone <a href="http://www.octave.org">
              Octave</a>.
	    <br> I'd like to mention that you can
	      <a href="http://www.software.polimi.it/en/software-download/students/">download from a Politecnico site</a>
              Excel, Mathematica, Matlab and many other applications
              and development tools.</br>
	</p>

          <p> Imho a pleasant alternative to proprietary stuff is
            the <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">Jupyter
            notebook</a> (e.g., <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57755729/boffi/nb/2016_Support_Motion.ipynb">
            here it is the solution</a> of a recently assigned problem).  <br> In
	    my classes I will use (and later distribute) a few
	    notebooks to demonstrate simple programmatic solutions to
	    complicated problems.
	  </p>
