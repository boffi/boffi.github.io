          <h2>Organization</h2>

          <p>I've planned 7 classes + 1 tutorial of four hours each,
            but this is still subject to changes.</p>

          <p><small>The workshop calendar, with the individual
              classes, visits, revisions is
              available <a href="https://beep.metid.polimi.it/c/document_library/get_file?groupId=136714061&folderId=0&title=Time+schedule+of+the+course">on
              Beep</a>.</small></p>

	  <p> The slides I use will be posted here after each class,
	    as well as solved problems and other classroom materials
	    [1], but please understand that the slides, etc, are not a
	    substitute for a real textbook (see below).<br />

            This being the 1st year for me, I cannot address you to
            the slides of previous years — I will try to post the
            slides in advance of classes but I'm afraid this won't be
            always possible.</p>
            
	  <p><small>[1] Other classroom materials means, mostly, small
              computer programs, written in
              the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming
		language</a>.

	  <h2>Exam</h2>

	  <p>The exam consists in a thorough review of your project,
	    including the structural design.<br />  Your design will
	    include a technical relation on the building, complete
	    with the detailed design of a few structural members, and
	    drawings of the structure and a few structural members.
	  </p>

            <tr>
              <td><p><img src="structures_cover.jpg" class="centerImage"
                          height="300" alt="" /></p>

          <p><small> As far as I can tell, the Campus Library has a
              few copies of "Structures" but very few when compared to
              your number.<br />  OTOH Toniolo's book being quite new,
              I don't think it is already available from the
              Library.<br />  IMO "Structures" is a good book for your
              self-study if you have a personal fondness for its
              subject... <br />
              Toniolo's is an in-depth text book that you
              may like better if you want to  grow a good designer
              of reinforced concrete structures but it's rather deep
              when compared to what we will see in my course...

	  <h2>Software</h2>

          <p>
            For your assignments you will need some help from your
            computer.  You may be tempted to search for a ready made
            app that promises to solve your immediate problem, or
            learn to use a spreadsheet or a scripting language to
            solve numerical problems in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            <small> As for scripting, the names that come to my mind
            are Matlab® and Python — you can use a Polimi academic
            license for Matlab and Python is free software.
            <ul>
              <li> You can download and install Matlab® from Polimi's
              following
                <a href="http://www.software.polimi.it/en/software-download/students/matlab/">
                  these instructions.</a></li>
              <li> You can download and install Python in over a 1000
              ways; ask Google "install python"
              (or <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">follow
              my advice</a>).
              </li>
            </ul>
            Due to time limits I won't be able to teach you how to use
            a
