            <a href="dati_2010/sol03.pdf">The solutions of the exercises in the summer assigment</a> are
            finally online (I had to wait until I was sure that no one
            would make a late submission for the last session of
            exams).</p><p>
            The grades are as follows: mat. 708980 is under 90 points,
            mat. 708980 133/150.  Other submissions were previously
            discussed face Ã  face.
          <h2>September is very close!</h2> <p>
            <a href="dati_2010/ha_03.pdf">The summer assignment</a> is
            here to download. This assignment is for (a) all the
            people who have not submitted assignment number 1 and (b)
            all the people who desire to better the degrees they got
            for the 1st assignment.  </p>
          <p> Please tell me about any problem you have in
            understanding the text of the problems.</p>
          <h2>September is nearing</h2> <p>
            All the students that have not submitted the 1st home
            assignment shall submit a different home assignment, that
            will be posted here sometimes before friday 23th of
            July. Details of the submission will be given in the text
            of the assignment</p>
          <h2>Multiple support excitation</h2> <p>
            As a stop gap measure, i post a link to <a
            href="bacheca/sd_08_09/lez10.djvu"> the notes of the
            lesson i gave in 2008-09</a>. The material covered is the
            same as this year lesson, the format of the file is a bit
            unusual, so you need <a
            href="http://www.caminova.net/en/downloads/download.aspx?id=1">a
            specific plugin</a> to read the notes</p>
          <h2>1st Home Assignment Results</h2> <p>
            I have mailed to all interested parties the file with your
            results. In case somebody finds a problem with the
            attachment, i post here <a href="dati_2010/ha01_deg.pdf">
            the results</a>.</p>
          <h2>Home assignment number two</h2> <p>
            The text of the second home <a href="dati_2010/ex3.pdf">assignment</a>
            are available. You must submit your solutions when you
            substain your oral examination.</p><p>
            The corrections of the first assignment are almost finished,
            I'll post the results here tomorrow.</p>	    
          <h2>Home assignment solutions</h2> <p> The <a
              href="dati_2010/hasol.pdf">solutions of the first home
              assignment</a> are available [2010-06-15].<br></br>
            Corrections and graduations proceed slowly. I hope to
            publish the results before the end of the month. </p>
          <h2 color="red">Red Alert</h2>
          <p>The first home assignment is out! The assignment is due on
          thursday 3rd of June <a href="dati_2010/ha01.pdf">and is now available here</a>.</p>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> The course deals with the dynamical response of mechanical
            systems, linear and non-linear, under the assumption of small
            displacements.</p>
          
          <p>Focus is given to analytical and numerical methods for the
            integration of the equations of motion, both in time and in
            frequency domain, to the numerical methods for the
            eigen-analysis of multiple degrees of freedom systems and to
            earthquake engineering applications.</p>
          
          <p>Classes include tutorials and computational exercises.</p>
          
          <p> During the semester, you'll be given two home assignments,
            the first one approximately in mid may, the second at the end of
            the lessons. Your degree will be based on the home assignments
            and on a final oral exam.</p>
          
          <p> The slides i use in classes will be made available on this
            page in a short time after the classes, but older versions of
            the slides are already available, as i taught the same course,
            more or less the same course, in the previous academic years,
            and if you want to peek at the material i posted during the
            previous year, 2008-2009, <a href="sd_2008.html"> it is still
              on line.</a></p>
          
          <p><small>Similar materials regarding the 2007-2008 course were put
              in the attic <a href="sd_2007.html">but are still available</a>
              should you need it.</small></p>
            
          <h2>Recommended books</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Ray W,Clough, Joseph Penzien,
              <a href="http://orders.csiberkeley.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=DOC%2DDYNOFSTR">
                Dynamics of Structures</a>.<br></br>
              Please note that the standard 2nd edition is out of
              press, but the link points to a software house that has bought
              the rights and issued a revised edition of the classic book by
              Clough and Penzien.</li>
            <li> Anil K.Chopra,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Prentice-Hall-International-Engineering-Mechanics/dp/013156174X/ref=sr_1_2/103-6948756-4924603?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193316341&sr=1-2">
                Dynamics of Structures </a> (Theory and Applications
              to Earthquake Engineering), 3rd ed.<br></br>
              A number of copies of this book are available from
              the campus library in Lecco.<br></br>
              Should you find a hugely discounted used copy
              of the 2nd edition of prof. Chopra's book, don't worry
              and buy it, the 2nd ed. is good enough for our
              purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>90% of the material you'll see in the first part of the course
            is inspired from Clough and Penzien's book, 90% of the material of
            the second part of the course from Chopra's.</p>
          <p>While it is very easy to follow the first part of the course
            using Chopra as your reference (the difference being in some
            notational convention and a more liberal use of examples in
            Chopra), following the second part of the course using the book
            from Clough and Penzien as a reference may be difficult.</p>
          <p>In short, should you prefer to buy a single book, buy Chopra's.</p>
          
          <h2>Home assignments</h2>
          
          <p>In general, the home assignments that you're supposed to do
            require no more than paper, pencil and a hand-held calculatur (or
            a decent spreadsheet program, <a
              href="http://office.microsoft.com/excel">Excel</a> or <a
              href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">OpenOffice
              Calc</a> the names that spring to mind...)</p>
          
          <p>Of course, anything more sophisticated than Excel (think of <a
              href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a
              href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, or of
            Matlab's free clone <a href="http://www.octave.org"> Octave</a>)
            can be helpful.</p>
          
          <p>When i work preparing and solving the assignments, my setup
            comprises:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/calc.html">Calc</a>, an
              advanced calculator and mathematical tool that runs as part of
              the GNU Emacs environment, that i use for its capabilities in
              symbolic manipulation of matrices and symbolic derivation
              and integration. It's not Mathematica, and it's very different
              from Mathematica, but it's useful and free.</li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
              itself, the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
              display editor.</li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Scipy</a>, a library of
              scientific tools for the programming language Python, i prefer
              using a set of libraries from inside a full blown programming
              language (Python) than an ad hoc one (Matlab, Octave). Of
              course, Matlab has different assets... (toolkits, i.e.)</li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> itself, an
              interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming
              language.</li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a>, a command-line
              driven interactive data and function plotting utility, for 2-
              and 3-D graphs, Gnuplot does also parametric plots, model
              fitting and something more.</li>
